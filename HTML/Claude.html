            <h2>BERTHE MORISOT AND THE ART OF THE 18TH CENTURY</h2>
            <h4> WATTEAU, BOUCHER, FRAGONARD, PERRONNEAU </h4>
            <p>From 18 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the Musée Marmottan Monet will present a very special exhibition, entitled Berthe Morisot and the Art of the 18th Century. The exhibition is curated by art historians Marianne Mathieu and Dominique d’Arnoult, with the participation of Claire Gooden, Head of Conservation at the Musée Marmottan Monet. Sixty-five art works from French and international museums, as well as private collections are brought together here for the first time to highlight the links between the work of the first female Impressionist Berthe Morisot (1841-1895) and the art of Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), François Boucher (1703-1770), Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806), and Jean-Baptiste Perronneau (1715-1783). Morisot's art, characterized by its subtle brushstrokes and keen observations of daily life, reflects the changing societal norms and roles of women during her era. The exhibition delves into the connections between Morisot's oeuvre and the artistic traditions of the 18th century, illuminating the influence and departure she embodied.</p>
