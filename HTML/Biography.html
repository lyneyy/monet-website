        <h2> The Legend, Claude Monet</h2>
        <h4> French, 1840-1926 </h4>
        <img src="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/media/30143/monet-claude-c-face-half.jpg?rxy=0.47368421052631576,0.36940298507462688&width=430&bgcolor=fff&rnd=132138120347600000">
            <p> <br> Monet was the originator of the Impressionist style and leader of the group of Impressionist artists in France in the 1870s and 1880s. Born in Paris on 14 November 1840, Claude-Oscar Monet was the son of a grocer. When he was five the family moved to Le Havre, on the Normandy coast. There he began to make pencil sketches of ships and produce caricature portraits which he exhibited in the framing shop where the painter Eugène Boudin worked. Boudin persuaded the young Monet to paint in the open air with him, observing nature directly. This plein-air technique of transferring perception to painted canvas, rather than remembering a scene and reproducing it in a studio, would become central to Impressionism. </br>
            <br> After a period of training at the Académie Suisse in Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Camille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne, Monet served in the military in Algeria during 1860 and 1861. The next year he entered the studio of Charles Gleyre, where he met Frédéric Bazille, Alfred Sisley and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. From the mid-1860s Monet began to explore the effects of light, painting impressions of what passes briefly before the eye. The first true Impressionist paintings date from around 1869, when Monet and Renoir worked together at La Grenouillère, a resort at Bougival on the River Seine. Rapidly painted, the canvases are covered in small strokes of colour that suggest light reflecting off lapping water. </br> 
            <br> It was at this first exhibition that the term 'Impressionists' was coined. Louis Leroy, a writer for the satirical paper Le Charivari, wrote sardonically of Monet's Impression: Sunrise (1873): 'Impression, I knew it! I also said to myself, since I'm impressed, there must be some impression in that. And what freedom, what technical ease! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than this seascape.' </br>
            <br> After the death of his second wife in 1911, Monet was cared for by his daughter-in-law Blanche, herself widowed in 1914. He died of lung cancer on 5 December 1926 in Giverny. In 1966 Monet's home and garden were left to the Académie des Beaux Arts in Michel Monet's will; restored from 1977 to 1980, they are now maintained by the Fondation Claude Monet and open to the public.</p>
