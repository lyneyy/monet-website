        <h2>History Of The Museum</h2>
        <p>Located in the hamlet of Passy, the Château de la Muette was dismembered and sold off in lots by the revolutionary government in 1790. Part of its former grounds were now occupied by the Ranelagh, a pleasure garden named after the Irish lord who had set this fashion in London. When Passy was absorbed into Paris in 1860, the land became municipal property and Baron Haussmann ordered that it be transformed into a garden, keeping the name Ranelagh. In the second half of the 19th century, the land giving onto this sixhectare park was prized by a wealthy clientele wishing to build mansions there. One of them was François Christophe Edmond Kellermann, duke of Valmy. Born in 1835, a diplomat, deputy, and man of letters, he purchased a plot of land between 20 Avenue Raphaël and 17 Boulevard Suchet on May 4, 1863 for the sum of 137,577 francs. The contract of sale stipulated the obligation to build there within the coming two years a bourgeois dwelling of at least 600 square meters. The duke’s plans were more ambitious, and in part speculative. Of the three townhouses he wanted to build, two were at the Boulevard Suchet end of the plot. The first, with a surface area of 282 square meters, was sold on July 13, 1866 to the painter Marie Paul Alfred Parent de Curzon, for 80,000 francs. The second, comprising a townhouse with a courtyard, a garden, and outbuildings, was acquired by one M. Lalande for 70,000 francs on November 27, 1866. Kellermann kept the third property, 2,020 square meters at 20 Avenue Raphaël, for himself. We know little aboutthis mansion except that the main building had a basement, a first floor and an upper floor, and was flanked by two pavilions, again with basements but with only one floor above. The property had a garden in the English style at the end of which, in the right-hand corner, stood an L-shaped building with a cut corner and comprising a ground-level and upper floor and a small inner courtyard with glazed surrounds. After the duke’s death in 1868, his wife and daughter could not afford to maintain the property and it was sold on June 7, 1882, to Jules Marmottan for 260,000 francs. </br>

</br> Born in Valenciennes on December 26, 1829, Marmottan came from a family in Le Quesnoy, northern France. After studying law he worked for a while with a Parisian stockbroker before taking up a position as director of Les Mines de Bruay in 1870. He made them into one of the leading mining companies in the Pas-de-Calais. As administrator of several French energy and transportation companies, he was also involved in their philanthropic activities. In 1879, he was made general treasurer of La Gironde. As an art lover, Marmottan took advice from Antoine Brasseur, a dealer who is remembered for donating sixty-four Old Master paintings and a sizeable collection of ceramics to the art museum in his home town of Lille. Through him, Marmottan acquired some forty paintings by pre-Renaissance artists from Italy, Flanders, and Germany, including an outstanding and rare Descent from the Cross by Hans Muelich. Polychrome wooden statuettes from Mechelen and tapestries of the lives of the saints Susanna and Alexander also illustrated his taste for medieval and Renaissance art. Acquired from a dealer long based in Cologne by an art lover who divided his life between Valenciennes and Bordeaux, these works would nevertheless end up decorating the Marmottan residence in Paris. When he died in Bordeaux on March 10, 1883, Jules left his only son Paul a substantial fortune and, by special bequest, the mansion in Avenue Raphaël as well as his collections. </br>

</br> Born in Paris on August 26, 1856, Paul Marmottan studied law at the University of Aix. On graduating, in 1880, he was attached to the office of the prefect of the Vaucluse and worked as a trainee barrister in the appeal court of Paris. He was made a councilor for the Eure prefecture in November 1882 but, when his father died, he asked to be given leave and renounced his career as a senior public servant. He moved to Paris and in 1885 married Gabrielle Rheims. They divorced, childless, in 1894, and the death in 1904 of Marie Martin, whom he had planned to take as his second wife, left Marmottan without heirs and inclined to a solitary existence. A man of independent means, he spent his time studying history and the art of the 1789–1830 period. He became a prolific author and a recognized specialist in the Consulate and Empire periods, helping to rehabilitate its often overlooked art. His research as a historian informed his acquisitions as an art lover working to emulate his father and build up his own collection. Paul Marmottan assembled his first acquisitions in the pavilion, which building he redecorated in the Empire style throughout. There he displayed effigies of members of the emperor’s family in Carrara marble. The carefully chosen furniture came, notably, from the Tuileries Palace, one of Napoleon’s residences, and the Palazzo Reale di Portici in Naples, which had been furnished for Napoleon’s sister, Caroline, the wife of Prince Murat. Marmottan also assembled a rare and representative collection of the still classical “petits maîtres” of the post-Revolutionary decades, whose landscapes were the subject of his book L’École française de peinture (1789–1830), published in 1886. This authoritative ensemble was hung in the pavilion at the turn of the 20th century. Among other canvases, landscapes by Jean Victor Bertin (p. 66), Étienne Joseph Bouhot, Louis Gauffier, Adolphe Eugène Gabriel Roehn, and Jacques François Joseph Swebach (known as Swebach-Desfontaines) were assembled around his outstanding pieces: six representations of imperial residences painted in around 1810 by Jean Joseph Xavier Bidauld in collaboration with Carle Vernet and Louis Léopold Boilly. Marmottan was a Boilly specialist and had written a landmark monograph on this painter. Some thirty portraits by the artist have always hung in the main house, and it is surely no coincidence that his name should have been given to the street laid perpendicular to Avenue Raphaël, alongside the collector’s townhouse, in 1913. </br>

</br> Paul Marmottan thought of this townhouse with its Empire salons and its picture gallery that in some ways was reminiscent of the old cabinets of curiosities as part of his greatest achievements. As well as Nélie Jacquemart-André before him, like Moïse de Camondo, Marmottan bequeathed his home to a cultural institution in order to preserve it and open it to the public, a task he entrusted to the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which inherited the building and its collections at his death on March 15, 1932. </br>

</br> As one of the foundations of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, the Musée Marmottan opened to the public on June 21, 1934. In keeping with its founder’s wishes, the small or ancillary rooms (kitchens, bathrooms, etc.) disappeared in order to create bigger spaces and facilitate visitor circulation. Apart from this physical adaptation, other changes awaited the museum as the aura of the Académie des Beaux-Arts attracted new donations and bequests. The museum enriched its collections and opened a new chapter in its history. </br> 

</br> Thanks to Michel Monet, the Impressionist collection would soon become one of the museum’s great riches. The younger son of Claude Monet, and the only son after the death of his brother Jean in 1914, he was his sole descendant, heir to the house in Giverny and all the works it contained, when the painter died in 1926. He thus received the paintings and drawings by masters and friends that his father had collected, including Eugène Delacroix, Eugène Boudin, Johan Barthold Jongkind, Gustave Caillebotte, Renoir, and Morisot. Above all, Michel inherited his father’s late works. Most of these were part of an ensemble of monumental canvases of water lilies. Between 1914 and 1926, Claude Monet painted 125 large panels, a selection of which he donated to his country, France. Monet refused to let this gift be revealed during his lifetime and what we now know as the Water Lilies of the Orangerie were not seen by the public until 1927. The exhibition caused a scandal; Monet’s last work then went into art historical purgatory. Michel, who owned the largest part of what remained from this great ensemble, found he was the owner of an inheritance that was denigrated. His efforts to rehabilitate the big Water Lilies had little impact in France, and the national museums bought none of the works he put on the market. This is one of the reasons why he decided against bequeathing his collection to the state. Instead, the childless Michel made the Musée Marmottan his sole legatee. When he died, in 1966, over a hundred Monets, including a unique ensemble of large-format Water Lilies, were added to the institution’s collection. Since the salons of Paul Marmottan’s townhouse were too small to show works on such a scale, a new room was specially designed under the garden. In 1970, these canvases, most of which had never been shown, were put on display. They form the world’s biggest collection of works by Claude Monet. The home of Paul Marmottan had grown and was now also the home of the father of Impressionism. The museum became known as the Musée Marmottan Monet. </br> </p>
